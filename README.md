# GisProject

This is a project made for an exam in Geographical Information Systems. It is a simple 2 page app which allows a user to save, view and rate locations on a map.

## Stack

For the map I used Mapbox, the backend is done with NodeJS, the database is Postgres and the mediator library used is called Sequelize.
The frontend is done in Angular.

## UPDATE

The app is not working at the moment due to a Heroku issue which I don't have the time to solve right now.
